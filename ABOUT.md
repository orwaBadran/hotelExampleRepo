<li>Firstly, I used spring boot to ease up the deployemnt and testing process.</li>
<li>The project could be done more easily, but I see my way as more mantainable, and readable.</li>
<li>I know the layout is not that importatnt but I couldn't live with the pure html look so I through some simple bootstarp, and jQuery in the page.</li>
<li>I tried to demonstrate some structure and seperate the layers through packages.</li>
</ul>
