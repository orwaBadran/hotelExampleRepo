Firstly, I used spring boot to ease up the deployemnt and testing process.
Maybe the project could be done more easily, but I see my way as more mantainable, and readable.
I know the layout is not that importatnt but I couldn't live with the pure html look so I through some simple bootstarp, and jQuery in the page.
I tried to demonstrate some structure and seperate the layers through packages.
